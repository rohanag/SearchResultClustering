'new iphone', 'buy new ipad'  accurately descibe cluster 1 which is about products from the apple store.
'apple computer' accurately descirbes cluster 2 which has informative results about Applce Computers Inc. This label could have been more specific.
'apple tree species', 'fruit apple tree' accurately describes cluster 3 about the apple tree and fruit species.
Cluster 4 is a bit ambigious combining a few results about apple id, and a few results about safari extensions. But both labels are found out by the system.
sale, 'ipad itunes' accurately describe the itunes store in cluster 5.
