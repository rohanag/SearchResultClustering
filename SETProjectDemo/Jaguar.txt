CLUSTER LABELS are:

Cluster 1
jaguar news
msn autos
new jaguar

Cluster 2
luxury
cars sale
automotive

Cluster 3
large feline
panthera onca
america jaguar largest

We will talk about the appropriateness of cluster labels. Taking each label one by one.
'jaguar news' accurately descibes cluster 1 which is about the latest news, models about jaguar.
'luxury' partially descirbes cluster 2 about luxury cars by jaguar, but in combination, the 3 labels describe the cluster.
'large feline' accurately describes cluster 3 about the animal jaguar.

It could be argued that Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 could be merged, but this is subjective. The user could want to see a seperate cluster for the latest news about Jaguar and a seperate cluster for information about the company and cars. I have chosen a low penalty, which encourages the creation of greater number of clusters, as I belive this does not dilute the user experience.
------------------------------------------------PURITY--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Number of Accurate labels in Cluster 1 are 5 / 7 (Result 3 and 6 are wrongly clustered) 
Number of Accurate labels in Cluster 2 are 8 / 9 (The last result is a news article and should be in cluster 1)
Number of Accurate labels in Cluster 3 are 4 / 4

PURITY = 17 / 20
       = 85 %
